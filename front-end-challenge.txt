Front End Challenge
===================

The Problem
-----------
We wish to integrate a new type of report into our system. The report is a
traffic counts table that lists, for various types of road user (such as
vehicles, bicycles, or pedestrians) the number counted traveling in certain
directions.

Wireframes
----------
The design wireframes are attached as is a sample of the data. There are two
major modes of the report; complete data and peak hour, which can be toggled.

The complete data view shows all the data in the provided data period in a
single table. The rows in this view should be demarcated into morning (AM) and
afternoon (PM) sections.

The peak hour data is a condensed view that shows only one hour of data for
the morning and one hour of data for the afternoon. This one hour of data is
selected as a sliding window which contains the highest level of traffic in
the particular period of the day. For example, the morning peak hour is
calculated over the data from 00:00 to 12:00 and shows the 60 minutes where
volume was the highest. The peak hour may not necessarily start on an hour
boundary; for example it could be from 03:45 to 04:45.

Vehicle and Bicycle Data
------------------------
The following abbreviations are used for vehicular directions:
* NB for northbound
* SB for southbound
* WB for westbound
* EB for eastbound

An entry with, for example, "NB" means that a particular number of the specified
vehicle types were traveling north.

The following abbreviations are used to indicate the lane used:
* L for the left turn lane
* T for through traffic
* R for the right turn lane

These abbreviations may be combined, with an entry of "TR" meaning a lane that
allows both through traffic and right turns.

Pedestrian Data
---------------
The following abbreviations are used for pedestrian crosswalks:
* N for north crosswalk
* S for south crosswalk
* W for west crosswalk
* E for east crosswalk

An entry with "N" means that a particular number of pedestrians were using the
north crosswalk.

The following abbreviations are used to indicate the direction of pedestrian
travel:
* CW for clockwise
* CCW for counter-clockwise

The directions of travel are based on observing the intersection above. For
example, a pedestrian count of "N" with a direction of "CCW" means that the
observed number of pedestrians were traveling on the north crosswalk,
traveling from east-to-west (counter-clockwise).

Challenge Notes
---------------
  1. You should be provided, along with this file, a file called
  "wireframes.pdf" which contains the design wireframes and a file called
  "data.json" which contains sample data.

  2. The result must be viewable in a web browser.

  3. Our preferred implementation language is Typescript as that is what our
  front end team primarily uses, though if you are more comfortable in other
  languages feel free to use them.
